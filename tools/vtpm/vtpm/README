Configuration of GNU MP Library
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Make sure that the GNU MP library is installed on your system (i.e.,
that the library file libgmp.a and the header file gmp.h exist). 
If not, you can download it from: http://www.gnu.org/software/gmp/gmp.html
or use one of the pre-compiled binaries for your distribution.

By defining the variables GMP_LIB and GMP_HEADER to the static GNU MP
library and the corresponding header file, respectively, some of the 
highly optimised GNU MP core functions (mpz_*, mpn_*) are linked against 
the kernel module. The possibility to use the adapted generic GNU MP 
sources is no longer supported.

Example:
GMP_LIB        := /usr/lib/libgmp.a
GMP_HEADER     := /usr/include/gmp.h

GNU MP Library on 64 bit Systems
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some 64-bit kernels have problems with importing the user-space gmp 
library (/usr/lib*/libgmp.a) into kernel space.  These kernels will require
that the gmp library be recompiled for kernel space with -mcmodel=kernel.

Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The compilation and installation process uses the build environment for 
external kernel modules of the 2.5.X Linux kernels, which must therefore
be setup properly. If you are using a pre-compiled standard kernel of 
some distribution, install the appropriate kernel-source packages and call
the following commands:

bash# cd /usr/src/linux
bash# make cloneconfig
bash# make prepare-all

The actual compilation and installation of the module is done as follows:

bash# tar -xvzf tpm_emulator-X.Y.tar.gz
bash# cd tpm_emulator-X.Y
bash# make
bash# make install


Startup
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The startup mode of the TPM emulator (see TPM Spec. Part 1, section 7.3) 
can be defined by means of a module parameter called startup, which can 
either be set to clear, save (default) or deactivated.

Note: If the emulator is started in mode 'save' and fails to load
a previously stored TPM state it will go into fail-stop mode and has
to be reloaded. Therefore, the first time the emulator module is 
loaded, startup SHOULD be set to 'clear':

bash# modprobe tpm_emulator startup="clear"

In order to recover a TPM emulator which is in fail-stop mode, it first
has to be deactivated and then reloaded in mode 'clear':

bash# modprobe tpm_emulator startup="deactivated"
bash# rmmod tpm_emulator
bash# modprobe tpm_emulator startup="clear"

Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* The name as well as the format of the persistent-storage file has 
  changed between release 0.2 and 0.3.
* The DAA support was tested with the IBM DAA Test Suite and should work 
  now as expected. Thanks go to Roger Zimmermann for his kindly help.
